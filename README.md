# zkwriter

Re-coding bburdette's zknotes (github.com/bburdette/zknotes) for educational purposes-- and possibly/probably personal use.

----

## Somewhat Urgent

- When to use rusqlite::{Result} + std::error::Error???

## Notes

- SQLContext is mostly an experiment, but I'd like to get it to work.
- Writing raw SQL cause I'm not an SQL-xpert
- DO I CALL IT STORE OR DB??!!!
- Need to better understand what a DB "View" is..

----

Will add multi-user functionality later.

----

- What's ZkListNote?
